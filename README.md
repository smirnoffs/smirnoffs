Ukrainian, father of 2, Software Engineer and Engineering Manager.

I'm a big fan of a quality engineering approach. Developers should design, build, and maintain their own quality pipeline. Every aspect of quality assurance that can be automated should be automated. The same goes for ops. There is no such role as DevOps. DevOps is a practice. Learn your infrastructure, own it, maintain it.
